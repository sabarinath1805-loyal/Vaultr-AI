Mike (MikeOSS) is an open-source legal AI platform for document review,
drafting, and legal research.

It has a Next.js frontend, an Express backend, Supabase Auth/Postgres, and
Cloudflare R2-compatible object storage.

Website: [mikeoss.com](https://mikeoss.com)

## Quick start with Docker

Run the whole application stack with one command and no Supabase or object
storage account. `docker-compose.yml` includes Supabase (Postgres, Auth, the
data API, and a gateway), RustFS, Mailpit, and the frontend/backend. The schema
loads itself on first boot.

Copy the local environment templates:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Edit `backend/.env`:

- Set `DOWNLOAD_SIGNING_SECRET` and `USER_API_KEYS_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` to separate
  values generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- Add an Anthropic, Gemini, or OpenAI API key, unless you plan to use Ollama
  exclusively.

Docker Compose supplies the local Supabase and object-storage settings, so
leave those values unchanged. Then start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and sign up.

Local service endpoints:

| Service | Address | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mike | `http://localhost:3000` | Main application |
| Supabase API | `http://localhost:54321` | Auth and data API gateway |
| Postgres | `localhost:54322` | Host access for database tools |
| RustFS console | `http://localhost:9001` | `rustfsadmin` / `rustfsadmin` |
| Mailpit | `http://localhost:8025` | Captured local auth email |

### What happens when you register

1. You sign up with email + password at `localhost:3000`.
2. The Auth service confirms the local user automatically.
3. The app signs you in without an email-confirmation step.

To test the confirmation-email flow, set
`GOTRUE_MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM=false` in the root `.env` and run
`docker compose up -d --force-recreate auth`. The confirmation message will be
available in Mailpit at **http://localhost:8025**; no mail leaves your machine.

> Mailpit catches auth email such as email-change messages and confirmation
> messages when autoconfirm is disabled. No email leaves your machine.

### Local models via Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.com) models are detected **dynamically** — whatever you
have installed (`ollama list`) shows up in every model picker under a **Local**
group, with no API key. The backend reaches Ollama on the host at
`http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1` (override with `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`) and
exposes the live list at `GET /models/ollama`.

Just pull a model and it appears after a refresh:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3.6
```

Notes:

- Models that support tool-calling can drive the full assistant; ones that
  don't (e.g. `phi3:mini`) still work for plain chat — the backend retries
  without tools automatically.
- Quality and speed depend on the local model; large models are noticeably
  slower for tabular review (which runs the model across many cells).

The Supabase JWT secret and the anon/`service_role` keys baked into
`docker-compose.yml` / `.env.example` are the well-known Supabase **local demo**
values — convenient for localhost, but regenerate them before exposing this
anywhere.

## Contents

- `frontend/` - Next.js application
- `backend/` - Express API, Supabase access, document processing, and database
  schema
- `backend/schema.sql` - Supabase schema for fresh databases
- `backend/migrations/` - dated, incremental schema migrations for existing
  deployments
- `docker-compose.yml` - complete local application and infrastructure stack
- `docs/` - testing, deployment safety, and feature-specific guides

## System Workflows

Mike's system assistant and tabular review workflows are maintained in the
[`Open-Legal-Products/mike-workflows`](https://github.com/Open-Legal-Products/mike-workflows)
repository.

## Manual or production deployment

Use this path when connecting Mike to managed Supabase and S3-compatible
storage rather than the infrastructure bundled in Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- git
- A Supabase project
- A Cloudflare R2 bucket, MinIO bucket, or another S3-compatible bucket
- At least one supported model provider API key, or an accessible Ollama server
- Optional: a CourtListener API token for case law lookup and citation verification
- LibreOffice installed locally if you need DOC/DOCX to PDF conversion

### Database setup

For a new Supabase database, open the Supabase SQL editor and run:

```sql
-- copy and run the contents of:
-- backend/schema.sql
```

The schema file is for fresh deployments and already includes the latest
database shape.

For an existing database, do not run the full schema over production data.
Apply the files in `backend/migrations/` dated after the deployed Mike version,
in filename order. Migration files use the format `YYYYMMDD_<name>.sql` and are
written to be safe to re-run.

### Environment

Copy the maintained examples:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local
```

Edit both files with the credentials and URLs for your deployment. The comments
in each example describe required and optional values.

These three `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are required when running
`npm run build --prefix frontend`. Next.js embeds public environment values in
the browser bundle at build time, so setting them only when starting or
deploying an already-built application is too late. Production builds fail
with a list of missing variables instead of producing a bundle that cannot
connect to Supabase or the backend API.

Supabase values come from the project dashboard. Use the project URL for
`SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, the service-role key for backend
`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, and the anon/public key for
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY`.

Model-provider keys and the CourtListener token can be configured globally in
`backend/.env` or per user under **Account > Models & API Keys**. If a provider
key is configured globally, the matching account field is read-only.

Supabase Auth, rather than the Mike backend, sends signup, email-change, and
password-recovery messages. Configure production SMTP in the Supabase dashboard
if those flows are enabled. Mike does not require a Resend API key.

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --prefix backend
npm install --prefix frontend
```

### Run locally without Docker

Start the backend and frontend in separate terminals:

```bash
npm run dev --prefix backend
```

```bash
npm run dev --prefix frontend
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

For production, build both packages and run their `start` scripts through your
process manager or deployment platform. The repository also includes Dockerfiles
for both applications.

## Tamper-Evident Export

Project exports include SHA-256 hashes for document versions and can optionally
be signed with Ed25519. See [Tamper-evident exports](docs/tamper-evident-exports.md)
for configuration, verification, and security considerations.

## CourtListener Integration

Mike can use CourtListener for US case law citation verification, case fetching,
targeted opinion search, and case-law panels in assistant responses.

To enable live CourtListener access, set `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` in
`backend/.env` and restart the backend. Users can also add their own token under
**Account > Models & API Keys** when the instance does not provide one globally.

Fresh databases created from `backend/schema.sql` already include the
CourtListener support tables. Existing deployments should apply the matching
dated migration in `backend/migrations/` before enabling the feature.

Bulk data is optional. When `COURTLISTENER_BULK_DATA_ENABLED=true`, Mike first
tries local Supabase/R2 data before falling back to CourtListener's API:

- citation metadata is read from `public.courtlistener_citation_index`
- case cluster metadata is read from `public.courtlistener_opinion_cluster_index`
- cached opinion JSON is read from the R2 prefix
  `courtlistener/opinions/by-cluster/{clusterId}/{opinionId}.json`

If you do not import bulk data, leave `COURTLISTENER_BULK_DATA_ENABLED=false`;
live CourtListener tools still work with a valid token, subject to CourtListener
rate limits.

## First Run

1. Sign up in the app.
2. If you did not set provider keys in `backend/.env`, open
   **Account > Models & API Keys** and add an Anthropic, Gemini, or OpenAI key.
3. To use legal research tools, add a CourtListener token in `backend/.env` or
   **Account > Models & API Keys**.
4. Create or open a project and start chatting with documents.

## Troubleshooting

**A local account says “Email not confirmed.”** Docker autoconfirms newly
created accounts by default. Accounts created before autoconfirm was enabled
remain unconfirmed. Confirm the existing message in Mailpit, or create a new
local account. To test confirmation deliberately, set
`GOTRUE_MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM=false` and recreate the `auth` service.

**Production auth email does not arrive.** Authentication email is sent by
Supabase Auth. Check the email-provider settings and configure production SMTP
in the Supabase dashboard.

**Port `54322` is already allocated.** Another local Postgres or Supabase stack
is using Mike's default host port. Stop that stack or start Mike with a different
mapping, for example `DB_PORT=54323 docker compose up --build`.

**The model picker shows a missing-key warning.** Add a key under
**Account > Models & API Keys**, or configure it in `backend/.env` and restart
the backend.

**CourtListener tools say the API token is missing.** Set
`COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` in `backend/.env`, or add a token under
**Account > Models & API Keys**. Restart the backend after changing `.env`.

**CourtListener bulk lookup is not returning local results.** Confirm
`COURTLISTENER_BULK_DATA_ENABLED=true`, the two CourtListener tables are
populated, and opinion JSON exists under `courtlistener/opinions/by-cluster/` in
R2. Mike falls back to the live API when bulk data is unavailable and a token is
configured.

**DOC or DOCX conversion fails.** Install LibreOffice and restart the backend so
the conversion command is available on the process path.

## Useful Checks

```bash
npm run build --prefix backend
npm run build --prefix frontend
npm run lint --prefix frontend
```
