# Mike Word Add-in

An Office.js task pane add-in that brings the Mike legal AI platform directly into Microsoft Word. From the task pane you can chat with an AI about the open document (with optional full-document context), apply AI suggestions as tracked-change redlines, run one-click actions (improve writing, proofread, anonymise, draft clause), execute saved Mike workflows against the document, and browse or upload to Mike projects — all without leaving Word.

The add-in talks to the **same API and Supabase project as the web app**: sign-in goes directly to Supabase (`/auth/v1/token`), while chat, actions, workflows, projects, and uploads call the Mike API (`http://localhost:3001` in local development).

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- Microsoft Word desktop (macOS or Windows) **or** Word on the web — sideloading steps differ; see below (desktop is the smoother path for local development)
- The Mike API running locally (`npm run dev` from `backend/`) and Supabase configured per the root [README](../README.md) (`backend/.env` + `frontend/.env.local`)
- A Mike user account — the pane signs in with the same credentials as the web app. Sign up through the web app once, or create a user in Supabase Auth (Dashboard → Authentication → Add user).
- For real model responses, a funded LLM API key in `backend/.env` — or use the keyless stand-in described in [Testing without an LLM key](#testing-without-an-llm-key).

---

## Quick start (one command)

If the API is already running and `frontend/.env.local` is filled in, this script does everything below for you — reads the Supabase URL + publishable key, writes `.env.development`, installs dependencies, installs the trusted dev certificate, and launches the add-in into Word:

```bash
bash word-addin/scripts/dev.sh
```

It is idempotent (safe to re-run) and only prompts you when it genuinely needs input — namely the **keychain/admin password** when installing the dev HTTPS certificate the first time. After the cert installs, **fully quit Word (Cmd-Q)** and re-run the script so Word reloads the trust.

The script verifies the backend before launching:

- **Mike backend** — `GET <api>/health`
- **Supabase** — `GET <supabase>/auth/v1/health`

If either is down it prints how to start them and **refuses to launch** (the task pane would just fail to sign in). Start the backend first:

```bash
# from backend/
npm run dev                  # the Mike API on :3001
```

Flags:
- `--setup-only` — do everything except the final `npm start` (prep deps/env/cert; report backend status without launching).
- `FORCE=1 bash word-addin/scripts/dev.sh` — launch even if the backend check fails (sign-in won't work until Mike is up).

The sections below explain each step the script automates, and the manual / web sideloading paths.

---

## Setup (manual)

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd word-addin && npm install
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**

   The webpack build reads these from `process.env` at compile time. Create a file called `.env.development` in `word-addin/`:

   ```bash
   # word-addin/.env.development
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your Supabase anon / publishable key>
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```

   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` / `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — the same values as `frontend/.env.local`'s `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY` (from the Supabase dashboard).
   - `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` — the Mike backend; default is `http://localhost:3001`.

   > **Mixed content / HTTPS:** Word serves the task pane over HTTPS (`https://localhost:3000`), and its WebView blocks plain-HTTP requests to the local backend. The `dev.sh` script avoids this by pointing the bundle at the dev server's same-origin HTTPS proxy (it sets the URLs to `https://localhost:3000` and proxies `/api` → `http://localhost:3001` and `/auth` etc. → Supabase). If you set the raw URLs above by hand, use `dev.sh` or replicate that proxy when testing in desktop Word.

   Because this is a custom webpack build (not Create React App), `.env.development` is **not** read automatically. Source it before running npm commands:

   ```bash
   set -a && source .env.development && set +a
   ```

3. **Trust the dev SSL certificate (one time only)**

   The dev server runs on `https://localhost:3000` with a self-signed certificate. Word refuses to load add-ins over untrusted HTTPS. Install the trusted cert once:

   ```bash
   npx office-addin-dev-certs install
   ```

   Restart Word after installing.

4. **Start the Mike backend**

   From the repo root:

   ```bash
   (cd ../backend && npm run dev)
   ```

5. **Start the add-in and sideload into Word**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This runs `office-addin-debugging start manifest.xml`, which starts the webpack dev server on `https://localhost:3000` **and** automatically opens Word with the add-in sideloaded. The task pane appears under **Home → Mike Legal AI → Open Mike**.

---

## Sideloading manually (if `npm start` does not auto-load)

### Word desktop — macOS

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Documents/wef
cp manifest.xml ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Documents/wef/
```

Restart Word, then: **Insert → Add-ins → My Add-ins → Mike**

### Word on the web

**Insert → Add-ins → Upload My Add-in** → select `manifest.xml`

> **Caveat — the pane will silently fail to load in a normal browser.** Word on the web is a *public* origin (`word-edit.officeapps.live.com`) and the dev pane is `https://localhost:3000`; Chrome's Local Network Access checks block a public page from embedding a localhost iframe, with no visible error — the pane simply never appears. This affects dev sideloads only (a deployed add-in on a public HTTPS host is unaffected). To test against real Word on the web locally, use the ready-made launcher, which starts a browser with those checks disabled, sideloads the manifest, opens the pane, and hands you the window:
>
> ```bash
> node e2e-live/word-web-session.mjs --login   # one-time Microsoft sign-in (persistent profile)
> node e2e-live/manual-session.mjs             # opens Word online with the pane ready
> ```

The manifest requires `WordApi 1.4`, which includes the change-tracking APIs. Word will not activate the add-in on a host that does not satisfy that requirement set.

## Production build

Production builds fail fast unless every service endpoint and the deployed add-in URL are explicit. This prevents publishing a bundle that silently calls localhost or has no Supabase key.

```bash
cd word-addin
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com \
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co \
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... \
REACT_APP_WEB_APP_URL=https://app.example.com \
WORD_ADDIN_PUBLIC_URL=https://word.example.com \
npm run build
```

The build writes the task-pane assets and a deployable, URL-rewritten manifest to `dist/`. The checked-in `manifest.xml` remains the localhost sideloading manifest.

## Features

### Chat tab

Ask any question about the open document. Toggle **Use document as context** to send the full document text to the AI with each message (posted to the backend as `documentContext`, which `POST /chat` nonce-fences into the system prompt as reference data). Responses stream in real time. On any AI response you can:

- **Insert below cursor** — inserts one or more real paragraphs after the paragraph containing the current selection; selected text is never overwritten
- **Insert below (tracked)** — performs the same paragraph-aware insertion with change tracking enabled, then restores the user's prior tracking mode

### Actions tab

One-click AI operations, each streaming their result into a result box:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Improve Writing** | Captures the exact selected range and rewrites it for clarity and professionalism. The result can replace that captured range with or without tracking. It never searches for and replaces a different duplicate elsewhere, and it refuses to apply if the selected range changed while the model was responding. |
| **Proofread** | Reviews the **entire document** for grammar, typos, punctuation, and stylistic issues. Streams each problem as an `ORIGINAL` / `REPLACEMENT` / `REASON` block, then offers **Apply N corrections (tracked)**: each original snippet is located in the document (exact, case-sensitive search) and replaced under `TrackAll`, producing genuine redlines the user can accept or reject in Word's Review tab. Corrections whose text can no longer be found (e.g. the document was edited after the scan) are skipped and reported, never guessed at. |
| **Anonymise** | Scans the **entire document** for PII (names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, IDs, etc.) and streams proposed anonymised replacements in the same format. **Apply N redactions (tracked)** replaces every occurrence of each PII string as a tracked change. |
| **Draft Clause** | Enter a description of the clause you need, then click **Draft clause**. The result is normalised from model Markdown into Word paragraphs and can be inserted below the cursor with or without tracking. |

### Workflows tab

Select a saved Mike workflow from the dropdown and click **Run workflow on document**. The workflow instruction and document context are sent to the API. Results stream in and can be inserted as paragraphs below the cursor.

### Projects tab

Browse Mike projects you have access to. Selecting a project shows all documents currently in it. Click **Upload current document to project** to export the open Word document as a `.docx` file and upload it to the selected project via the Mike backend.

---

## Signing in

Enter the same email and password you use for the Mike web app. The add-in authenticates directly against Supabase (`/auth/v1/token`) and stores the access token in `OfficeRuntime.storage` (persists across task pane reloads). Click **Sign out** in the header to clear the token.

---

## Tests

The add-in ships a strict TypeScript check and a hermetic Playwright e2e suite that runs entirely against a mocked Office.js host and a stubbed backend — no Word, Supabase, or live backend required:

```bash
cd word-addin
npm run typecheck
npm run build:e2e
npm run test:e2e
```

It builds the bundle with test env vars, serves it over plain HTTP, injects an Office.js mock (`e2e/support/office-mock.ts`), and drives every task-pane flow (auth, chat, actions, workflows, projects).

---

## Testing without an LLM key

No funded API key? `e2e-live/anthropic-stub.mjs` is a tiny local server that speaks the Anthropic Messages streaming protocol and returns scripted answers keyed to the add-in's prompts (chat redlines, proofread, anonymise, improve, draft). Everything else stays real — Supabase auth, the Mike backend, SSE streaming, and the Word JS API tracked changes:

```bash
node e2e-live/anthropic-stub.mjs &                          # listens on :4141
# then start the backend pointed at it:
(cd ../backend && ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4141 npm run dev)
```

The stub's answers are static, so exercise it with the document flaws it scripts against (see the constants at the top of `anthropic-stub.mjs` and `e2e-live/word-web-full-demo.mjs`). The full live demo — every button against real Word on the web, recorded to video — runs with `node e2e-live/word-web-full-demo.mjs`.

## Troubleshooting

**Word shows "The content is blocked because it isn't signed by a valid security certificate" — including when it worked before**
This is *certificate trust drift*, and it will eventually happen to every returning developer: the dev certificate expires after ~30 days, and the tooling then silently regenerates it **with a new signing CA** (the webpack dev server does this on startup). Your OS keychain still trusts only the *old* CA, so Word rejects the pane — while `npx office-addin-dev-certs verify` misleadingly reports "trusted", because it only checks that a CA *by that name* exists, not that it signed the current certificate. `npx office-addin-dev-certs install` then refuses to reinstall for the same reason.

`bash scripts/dev.sh` now detects and repairs this automatically (it verifies the real chain against the OS trust store). To fix it by hand on macOS:

```bash
# 1. Ground truth — does the OS trust the cert actually being served?
security verify-cert -c ~/.office-addin-dev-certs/localhost.crt -p ssl -s localhost

# 2. If that fails: force a real reinstall (approve the keychain prompt)
npx office-addin-dev-certs uninstall
npx office-addin-dev-certs install

# 3. Verify step 1 again; if still untrusted, trust the current CA directly:
security add-trusted-cert -r trustRoot \
  -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db ~/.office-addin-dev-certs/ca.crt
```

Then **fully quit Word (Cmd-Q)** — its webview caches trust decisions — and relaunch with `npm start`.

**`npm start` fails with `EEXIST: file already exists, link 'manifest.xml' -> …/wef/….manifest.xml`**
A previous run exited without deregistering (crash, Ctrl-C) and left the sideload hard-link behind. `npm start` now clears this automatically via its `prestart` hook; if you hit it anyway, run `npm run stop` and retry.

**`npm start` / `dev.sh` complains port 3000 is in use**
The add-in dev server and the manifest are hardwired to `https://localhost:3000`, which collides with the Mike web app's dev server. Find the holder with `lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN` and stop it (usually `npm run dev` in `frontend/`).

**The pane never appears in Word on the web**
See the caveat under [Word on the web](#word-on-the-web) — Chrome's Local Network Access checks silently block the localhost iframe; use `e2e-live/manual-session.mjs`.

**Add-in shows blank after the cert is trusted**
Right-click the task pane → **Inspect** and check the console for errors. A common cause is a missing or wrong `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` / `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — the bundle compiles with empty strings if the env vars were not exported before `npm start`.

**Login fails with "Login failed" or a 401**
Confirm the `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` / `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env.development` match `frontend/.env.local`, and that the URL has no trailing slash.

**Tracked insertion is unavailable**
The add-in requires WordApi 1.4. Confirm the Word host and build support that requirement set; otherwise use a supported Microsoft 365 Word client.

**Document upload fails**
- Confirm the Mike API is running (`npm run dev` in `backend/`) and reachable at `http://localhost:3001`
- Confirm the API's configured object-storage bucket exists
- Check the backend logs for the specific error

**Workflows tab shows "No workflows found"**
Workflows are fetched from `GET /workflows` on the Mike backend. Confirm the backend is running and that at least one workflow exists in the database.
