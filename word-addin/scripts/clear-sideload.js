/**
 * Best-effort `office-addin-debugging stop` before every `npm start`
 * (wired as the npm "prestart" hook).
 *
 * Why: office-addin-debugging registers the add-in by hard-linking
 * manifest.xml into Word's sideload folder. If a previous run exited
 * without `npm run stop` (crash, Ctrl-C, killed terminal), the link is
 * left behind and the next `npm start` dies with an opaque
 * "EEXIST: file already exists, link 'manifest.xml' -> …/wef/….manifest.xml".
 * Stopping first makes `npm start` idempotent.
 *
 * Failures are swallowed on purpose: on a clean machine there is nothing
 * to stop, and a broken stop must never block start (start will surface
 * its own, more actionable, error).
